Join us for our annual summer picnic at [Lola Valley Park ](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.4106152,-83.3030205,17z)in Redford, MI on Sunday, August 5, 2018. The picnic will start at 1pm. Park Players will be grilling and providing meat and vegetarian options as well as water and lemonade. All members are encouraged to bring a side item. (See assignments below). 

We will be in "Area A," located at the intersection of Kinloch and Lola Dr. The easiest way to get into the park is to enter from 6 mile rd onto Kinloch heading South (The intersection is West of Beech Daly). Kinloch will lead you directly to the park entrance.
