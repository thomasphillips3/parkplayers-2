 ## Detroit Sidewalk 2017

It was a cooler than normal evening on August 5th when a group of Park Players took the stage at the [5th Annual Sidewalk Festival of the Performing Arts](http://sidewalkdetroit.com/) and delivered a staged reading of excerpts from *To Be Young, Gifted and Black*. This was the second year Players has participated in the festival, and it contained plenty of surprises. We were greeted by a contingent of fans and there was not an empty seat to be seen!

This year's Sidewalk theme was **Radical Moment(um)**, and scenes from our fall show perfectly fit material to perform. Lorraine Hansberry's work deals with the many complex social/ racial issues of her time. If that weren't enough radical talk, there is the stark realization that most of the issues she wrote about are still unresolved today.

We are excited that a few Players who will be unavailable for the full show this fall were able to participate in the reading. We got to hear from **Mary Davis**, who has been absent from our stage during my time with Players. And **Steve Spencer** was there fresh off knee surgery (Get well Steve!). **Thomas Philips** was able to join us and he never gets to do anything with us due to work. Even **Tamara Kamara** found time in her busy schedule to lend her voice to the reading!

The full cast included **Sadie Bernice**, **Stefan Lee**, **Karen Curtsinger**, **Mary Davis**, **Steve Spencer**, **Tamara Kamara**, **Thomas Philips** and **Archie Lynch**. All coached and directed by **Angela Riley** and **Roger Loeb**.

Thank you to all that came out to Sidewalk to see us. For those who didn't make it out to the festival, there is always next year!
