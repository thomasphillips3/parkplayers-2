Park Players is excited to again be performing at the 6th annual [Sidewalk Detroit Street Festival](http://sidewalkdetroit.com/) for Visual & Performing Arts. This will be the 3rd year we have performed at the festival, and this year we will feature an original adaptation of The Cloud Spinner. It's a touching children's story that teaches about ecology and conservation. 

The production team includes 

* Katy Schoetzow
* Emilio Rodriguez
* Bobbi Lucas

Along with the wonderful cast they have brought together

* Sadie Bernice
* Jillian Craighead
* Jonathan Curry
* Marie Muhammad
* Dinah Tutein

The Sidewalk Festival takes place right on Lahser Rd in front of the [Redford Theatre](https://redfordtheatre.com/) and all around the surrounding block. Our performance will be at 4:30 on Saturday, August 4th, on the alley stage. The Cloud Spinner will run about 25 minutes. Come on out and cheer on the cast as they bring this new piece to life for the first time!
