We had the good fortune to approached by Anthony Lanzilote and asked to be part of his article on the Grandmont Rosedale neighborhood. Anthony grew up in North Rosedale Park before moving to New York and writing about theatre (among other things) as a freelance writer. So when he said he want to come that pictures of Shrek on the final performance I was a little nervous. He has reviewed Broadway shows! 

Please take a few minutes and read [his wonderful article](http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/grandmont-rosedale-grassroots-060918.aspx?utm_source=Emma&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=The+most+grassroots+community+in+Detroit%3f+Grandmont+Rosedale+abounds+in+homegrown+outlets&utm_content=Newsletter&utm_campaign=What%27s+the+most+grassroots+neighborhood+in+Detroit%3f).
