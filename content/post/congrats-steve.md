Our very own Steve Spencer was honored as the Parade Company Volunteer of the Year in honor of his 27 years of service to our Thanksgiving Day parade. <!--more --> Steve serves as a tour guide, tour guide trainer, Clownie mascot, and a volunteer captain for the Ford Fireworks Rooftop Party.  He and his family got to ride the Mother Goose float in the parade. He looked great smiling and waving to the enthusiastic parade watching crowd.
