Park Players' will perform both Male and Female versions for one of Neil Simon’s most popular works, The Odd Couple. The male version is set in the 1960's and the female version is set in the 1980's. Both about two very mismatched “best friends,” who are forced to live together due to circumstance. One is a helpless slob, while the other is an uptight neat freak - a recipe for disaster!
