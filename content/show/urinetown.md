<!--Add details about the show below.-->
*Urinetown - The Musical* entertained audiences with its lively satire and comical musical numbers. With a great cast of old and new members, and in the capable hands of talented director Sarah Hedeen and music director Rich Alder, the quirky subject matter of this tongue-in-cheek play sprang to life, delighting audiences with sarcastic anti-musical commentary.
