What better way to enjoy the Halloween season than with a murder mystery? The Park Players are proud to invite you for a night of suspense and surprises as they perform Agatha Christie's _A Murder is Announced_, adapted for the stage by Leslie Darbon.

Reflecting the lifestyle and morality of 1950s England, the play is set in the old Victorian home of Miss Letitia Blacklock, who has opened her house to several boarders. The occupants include Miss Blacklock's niece and nephew, her old school chum, and a single working mother. It should come as no surprise to fans of Christie that no one is exactly who they say they are. Soon enough, mixed motives and murder create the scene for an unforgettable evening of mystery. Come along as determined inspector Craddock doggedly traces the twists and turns of the surprising plot, and the indomitable Miss Marple steps in to provide the final, brilliant solution!

The cast and crew have been working hard to perfect this intriguing tale of suspense for theatergoers. Many regular Park Players performers, whom you may remember from Dreamgirls, are back, including Linda Witherspoon playing the part of Miss Marple, and Steven Spencer as Inspector Craddock. Jeannette Steinhauer, who last appeared in Our Town, is taking on the challenging role Miss Blacklock. Also returning to the stage are Theresa Chatman (playing the part of Bunny in her first major role), Thomas Phillips, Carley Matkovich, Jonathan Jones, Wendy Krekeler, and Maggie Tibus. Newcomers to The Park Players include Toni Hammond, Michael Newhouse and Leonard Zabawski.
