People can't stop talking about Park Players production of _Alice Through the Looking Glass_! Just read this glowing article from the MetroTimes: [The Park Players offer a uniquely Detroit take on Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice’](http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/the-park-players-offer-a-uniquely-detroit-take-on-lewis-carrolls-alice/Content?oid=2267613). 

"Katy Schoetzow (pictured above) shines as the titular character, carrying the play by conveying both a girlish innocence and an animated cartoon character quality." -Lee Devito

Some of the cast (Montellis Whitt, Jonathan Jones, and Liz Dickson with guest) enjoying the opening night cast party. We at Park Players like to put the "community" in community theater. Thank you for walking through the looking glass with us, and being a part of Alice and her incredible adventures!
