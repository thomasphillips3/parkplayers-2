Shakespeare's *Much Ado About Nothing* is one of the most beloved and accessible of all his enduring comedies. Our version is a modern, relatable adaptation, with more approachable language, suitable for all ages.

The play promises to have a distinctive character and style under the talented direction of [Carollette Phillips](http://www.carollette.com/), long-time Park Players member and recent MFA graduate from Wayne's State's theater program.

This marks the second production of a Shakespearian play by the Park Players (the first being the hugely successful A Midsummer Night's Dream in 2000). We're very pleased to bring another timeless classic to life, right here in North Rosedale Park!

> People often think of Shakespeare as rigid or inaccessible but as audiences will soon see, it is quite the opposite! The incorporation of music and dance styles that span a variety of decades gives our production of Much Ado About Nothing an engaging, contemporary twist. Our cast includes actors of diverse ages, backgrounds and levels of training, which really gives the show a great amount of color and a fresh outlook on the Bard's classic.<br><br>

> Throughout the rehearsal process actors have worked diligently to develop unique characters and master this story in a way that allows them to bring the language to life and present a production that is creative and exciting! Our actors boldly attack the combination of comedy, drama, love, hate, jealousy and redemption illustrated throughout this production. One of the best elements of Shakespeare's plays is the fact that they always deal with these types of universal themes and situations. Recognizing this closeness to our present society and circumstances makes Much Ado resonate all the more with the cast and is sure to have the same impact on the audience.<br><br>

> Also, this production features several actors who are new to Park Players and bring with them an incredible amount of talent and energy. It is exciting to have them on board and witness the spirit they infuse into this production. Don't miss what is certain to be a Shakespearian sensation!
