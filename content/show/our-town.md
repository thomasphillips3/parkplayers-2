The Park Players are thrilled to present their upcoming fall performance of *Our Town* by Thornton Wilder (performed by special arrangement with Samuel French, Inc.). Veteran Park Players director Sarah Hedeen offers a fresh interpretation of this American classic, produced by Mary Davis and Carly Matkovich. Now's the time to reserve your place for this limited engagement!

*Our Town* gently advises us to appreciate life while we are living it, particularly the uneventful, ordinary activities - smelling flowers, eating breakfast, looking out the window at the silent moon.

This play is guaranteed to pull at your heart strings and inspire your soul.

As with all Park Players performances, the show will be at the North Rosedale Park Community House 18445 Scarsdale, Detroit, MI 48223.
