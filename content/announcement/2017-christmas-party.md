## Sunday, December 17 at 6:00pm
With our recent move to Redford Theatre, this will be a very special party! Our annual Christmas gathering will be held at the Community House on December 16 at 6pm. We'll be singing our favorite carols, hymns, and songs around the piano, and Santa will be in the building! Please come join us for a fun-filled evening of joy, celebrating the holiday season, and enjoying the presence of good friends.

Please bring a holiday dessert or small dish to share if you'd like!

## MVP Award Presentation
We have so much to be thankful for this holiday season! We are made of a community of passionate volunteers. One particular Player went way above and beyond for us, and made much of our progress this year possible. For his hard work in helping us to (FINALLY) achieve 501\(c\)3 status, we would like to present George Evalt with a special award. Thanks so much George!
