# Our Neighborhood

From our inception through 2017, Park Players performed at the North Rosedale Park Community House, which was built in 1939. We were born in the center and the heart of the historic and lovingly maintained North Rosedale Park neighborhood (which has a very colorful history dating to the 1920s).

In addition to being the home of the Park Players, the community house serves the various neighborhood groups - from the girl scouts to the ski club - and is also the home of the [North Rosedale Civic Association](http://www.northrosedalepark.org/), a community organization that sponsors the annual house walk and other events, which are open to the public and showcases the neighborhood's beautiful homes, curving tree-lined streets, stunning architecture and gardens.

# Our Theater Troupe

The Park Players of [Detroit](http://www.detroitmi.gov/) have been presenting theatrical productions without interruption since the early 1950s.

Like Detroit, the Park Players have undergone tremendous change. What started as a restricted group for residents of the exclusive Detroit neighborhood of North Rosedale Park – with the group’s first show being a minstrel show – has grown into a multi-cultural and diverse community theater group with membership from all across S.E. Michigan.

The Park Players of today feature a policy of racial- and gender-inclusive casting, and the group specializes in producing thought-provoking theater and musicals. Some of the recent past productions include _Palmer Park_, _The Laramie Project_, _Dead Man Walking_ (in conjunction with Divine Child High School), _The Wiz_, _To Kill A Mockingbird_, _Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat_, _Moon Over Buffalo_, _Smoky Joe’s Café_, _Ragtime_ and _One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest_.
